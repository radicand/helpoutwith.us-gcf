# helpoutwith.us-gcf
Graph.cool schema for [helpoutwith.us](https://github.com/radicand/helpoutwith.us)

You'll need the graph.cool framework installed (ideally locally for development), as well as direnv. Create a free Mailjet account and populate the .envrc file with the API details if you want to test mailing. (You'll also need to edit the relevant pieces of code to change the template IDs to your own testing versions. Future updates may make this easier to configure.)
